# SpadesAI

Here is a setup which will allow the a Spades AI to train itself. 
Much work is still needed, but the initial setup is there. 

A needed library is pyCardDeck, which can be installed with relative ease. 

Currently, the bot simply plays legal plays, but other than that the cards it chooses are completely arbritrary.
